    "# 1. What is the relationship between def statements and lambda expressions ?\n",
    "   Answer: def statements are used to create named functions in python and lambda expression is also used to create function. \n",
    "   However there is a difference that lamda expression is used to create anonymous functions that is a funtion without name \n",
    "   and can be used only to create one liner expressions as functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#2. What is the benefit of lambda?\n",
    "   Answer: We have to write fewer lines or code, it executes faster.\n",
    "#3. Compare and contrast map, filter, and reduce.\n",
    "   Answer:\n",
    "#4. What are function annotations, and how are they used?\n",
    "    Answer:\n",
    "    Function annotation is the standard way to access the metadata with the arguments and the return value of the function.\n",
    "    These are nothing but some random and optional Python expressions that get allied to different parts of the function.\n",
    "    They get evaluated only during the compile-time and have no significance during the run-time of the code.\n",
    "    They do not have any significance or meaning associated with them until accessed by some third-party libraries.\n",
    "    They are used to type check the functions by declaring the type of the parameters and the return value for the functions.\n",
    "    The string-based annotations help us to improve the help messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Syntax :\n",
    "        def func(a: 'int') -> 'int':\n",
    "            pass\n",
    "\n",
    "    Annotations for simple parameters:\n",
    "        def func(x: 'float'=10.8, y: 'argument2'):\n",
    "            In the above code the argument, ‘x’ of the function func, \n",
    "            has been annotated to float data type and the argument ‘y’ \n",
    "            has a string-based annotation. The argument can also be \n",
    "            assigned to a default value using a ‘=’ symbol followed \n",
    "            by the default value. These default values are optional to the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Annotations for return values:\n",
    "        def func(a: expression) -> 'int':\n",
    "            The annotations for the return value is written after the ‘->’ symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "#5. What are recursive functions, and how are they used?\n",
    "   Answer: A function that calls itself during the execution is known as recursive function. It stops calling itself only when\n",
    "   a particular condition is met.\n",
    "   Example:#recursive function to add\n",
    "    count=0\n",
    "    suml=0\n",
    "    def add(l):\n",
    "        global count\n",
    "        global suml\n",
    "        if count ==len(l):\n",
    "            return suml\n",
    "        suml=l[count]+suml\n",
    "        count=count+1\n",
    "        return add(l)\n",
    "    add([1,2,3,22,4,5])\n",
    "\n",
    "#6. What are some general design guidelines for coding functions?\n",
    "   Answer: \n",
    "        .The name of the function should describe its purpose. \n",
    "        .Function should not be lengthy, if it is it should be broken down into small functions.\n",
    "        .Name of variables should be indicate their purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "#7. Name three or more ways that functions can communicate results to a caller.\n",
    "    Answer: Function can communicate results to caller in the form of a single value, list, tuple, dictionary, class object etc."
